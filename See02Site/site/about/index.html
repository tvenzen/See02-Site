        <p>Hello, we are a group of environmentally wary students that wanted to help bring to light the damage we are causing to the environment of our slowly declining planet. CO2 entering the atmosphere has harmful effects to the environment such as raising the global temperature, causing the polar glaciers to melt, raising the sea level of the planet. If this isn’t mitigated, our homes could end up becoming submerged underwater. This is no longer a problem that we can “ignore for the younger generation to handle”, because we are the younger generation. Thankfully, trees and other plants have the ability to take CO2 out of the atmosphere due to their natural processes. You can do your part by donating for trees to become planted, or to use alternative ways to travel by carpooling, or taking public transportation to lower your carbon footprint. Remember, the future of tomorrow is in <i> our </i> hands!</p>
